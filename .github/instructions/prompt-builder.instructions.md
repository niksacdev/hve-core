# Prompt Builder Instructions

Authoring standards for prompt engineering artifacts govern how prompt, agent, instructions, and skill files are created and maintained. Apply these standards when creating or modifying any of these file types.

## File Types

This section defines file type selection criteria, authoring patterns, and validation checks.

### Prompt Files

*Extension*: `.prompt.md`

Purpose: Single-session workflows where users invoke a prompt and Copilot executes to completion.

Characteristics:

* Single invocation completes the workflow.
* Frontmatter includes `agent: 'agent-name'` to delegate to an agent.
* Content ends with `---` followed by an activation instruction. Activation lines apply only to prompt files; agent and instructions files do not use them.
* Use `#file:` only when the prompt must pull in the full contents of another file.
* When the full contents are not required, refer to the file by path or to the relevant section.
* Example: `#file:path/to/file.md` pulls in the full file contents at that location.
* Input variables use `${input:variableName}` or `${input:variableName:defaultValue}` syntax.

Consider adding sequential steps when the prompt involves multiple distinct actions that benefit from ordered execution. Simple prompts that accomplish a single task do not need protocol structure.

#### Input Variables

Input variables allow prompts to accept user-provided values or use defaults:

* `${input:topic}` is a required input, inferred from user prompt, attached files, or conversation.
* `${input:chat:true}` is an optional input with default value `true`.
* `${input:baseBranch:origin/main}` is an optional input defaulting to `origin/main`.

An Inputs section documents available input variables:

```markdown
## Inputs

* ${input:topic}: (Required) Primary topic or focus area.
* ${input:chat:true}: (Optional, defaults to true) Include conversation context.
```

#### Argument Hints

The `argument-hint` frontmatter field shows users expected inputs in the VS Code prompt picker:

* Keep hints brief with required arguments first, then optional arguments.
* Use `[]` for positional arguments and `key=value` for named parameters.
* Use `{option1|option2}` for enumerated choices and `...` for free-form text.

```yaml
argument-hint: "topic=... [chat={true|false}]"
```

Validation guidelines:

* When steps are used, follow the Step-Based Protocols section for structure.
* Document input variables in an Inputs section when present.

### Agent Files

*Extension*: `.agent.md`

Purpose: Agent files support both conversational workflows (multi-turn interactions with a specialized assistant) and autonomous workflows (task execution with minimal user interaction).

#### Conversational Agents

Conversational agents guide users through multi-turn interactions:

* Users guide the conversation through different activities or stages.
* State persists across conversation turns via planning files when needed.
* Frontmatter defines available `tools` and optional `handoffs` to other agents.
* Typically represents a domain expert or specialized assistant role.

Consider adding phases when the workflow involves distinct stages that users move between interactively. Simple conversational assistants that respond to varied requests do not need protocol structure. Follow the Phase-Based Protocols section for phase structure guidelines.

#### Autonomous Agents

Autonomous agents execute tasks with minimal user interaction:

* Executes autonomously after receiving initial instructions.
* Frontmatter defines available `tools` and optional `handoffs` to other agents.
* Typically completes a bounded task and reports results.
* May run subagents for parallelizable work.

Use autonomous agents when the workflow benefits from task execution rather than conversational back-and-forth.

#### Subagents

Subagents are agent files that execute specialized tasks on behalf of parent agents.

Characteristics:

* Optionally include `user-invocable: false` frontmatter to hide the subagent from the user and prevent direct invocation.
* Frontmatter includes `tools:` listing the tools available to the subagent.
* Typically live under `.github/agents/subagents/` to separate them from user-facing agents.
* Parent agents declare subagent dependencies in their `agents:` frontmatter.
* Referenced using glob paths like `.github/agents/**/name.agent.md` so resolution works regardless of whether the subagent is at the root or in the `subagents/` folder.
* Cannot run their own subagents; only the parent agent orchestrates subagent calls.

Subagents follow the same authoring standards as other agent files. Include a Response Format section defining the structured output the subagent returns to its parent.

#### Subagent Structural Template

All subagents in the codebase follow a canonical section pattern. Use this template when creating new subagents:

1. H1 Title matching the agent name.
2. Opening line restating the purpose from the frontmatter description.
3. Purpose section with bulleted objectives defining what the subagent provides.
4. Inputs section listing required and optional inputs with bullet formatting.
5. Intermediate output section (named per context, such as *Execution Log*, *Evaluation Log*, or *Research Document*) defining the progressive output artifact.
6. Required Steps section with a pre-requisite step followed by numbered steps.
7. Required Protocol section defining execution meta-rules.
8. Response Format section defining the structured return to the parent agent.

```markdown
# Agent Name

Brief restatement of purpose from frontmatter description.

## Purpose

* First objective.
* Second objective.

## Inputs

* Required input with description.
* (Optional) Optional input with description.

## Output Artifact Name

Create and update the artifact progressively documenting:

* Findings and decisions.
* Evidence and references.

## Required Steps

### Pre-requisite: Setup

1. Create the output artifact with placeholders if it does not already exist.
2. Read and follow instructions from referenced files in full.
3. Load context from provided inputs.

### Step 1: Core Work

1. Execute the primary task.
2. Update the output artifact progressively.

## Required Protocol

1. Follow all Required Steps.
2. Repeat as needed to ensure completeness.
3. Finalize the output artifact.

## Response Format

Return structured findings including:

* Path to the output artifact.
* Status of the work.
* Key details and recommendations.
* Clarifying questions.
```

### Instructions Files

*Extension*: `.instructions.md`

Purpose: Auto-applied guidance based on file patterns. Instructions define conventions, standards, and patterns that Copilot follows when working with matching files.

Characteristics:

* Frontmatter includes `applyTo` with glob patterns (for example, `**/*.py`).
* Applied automatically when editing files matching the pattern.
* Define coding standards, naming conventions, and best practices.

#### Recommended Sections

Instructions files typically include these sections based on codebase patterns:

* H1 Title reflecting the domain or technology.
* Scope or applicability statement.
* Core conventions and standards as bulleted rules.
* Code examples in fenced blocks demonstrating correct patterns.
* Patterns to avoid, when relevant.
* Validation guidance or tooling references.

#### Sizing Guidance

Instructions files in the codebase range from approximately 90 lines (focused, single-concern files like commit message conventions) to 300 lines (comprehensive guides like markdown standards). Target the size that covers the domain without padding:

* Under 100 lines for narrow, single-concern topics.
* 100 to 200 lines for standard coding conventions with examples.
* 200 to 300 lines for comprehensive multi-section guides.
* Over 300 lines may indicate the file should be split into focused parts.

Validation guidelines:

* Include `applyTo` frontmatter with valid glob patterns.
* Content defines standards and conventions.
* Wrap examples in fenced code blocks.

### Skill Files

*File Name*: `SKILL.md`

*Location*: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Purpose: Self-contained packages that bundle documentation with executable scripts for specific tasks. Skills differ from prompts and agents by providing concrete utilities rather than conversational guidance.

Characteristics:

* Bundled with bash and PowerShell scripts in the same directory.
* Provides step-by-step instructions for task execution.
* Includes prerequisites, parameters, and troubleshooting sections.

Skill directory structure:

```text
.github/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill definition (required)
├── scripts/                    # Executable scripts (optional)
│   ├── <action>.sh             # Bash script for macOS/Linux
│   └── <action>.ps1            # PowerShell script for Windows
├── references/                 # Additional documentation (optional)
│   └── REFERENCE.md            # Detailed technical reference
├── assets/                     # Static resources (optional)
│   └── templates/              # Document or configuration templates
└── examples/
    └── README.md               # Usage examples (recommended)
```

### Optional Directories

#### scripts/

Contains executable code that agents run to perform tasks:

* Scripts are self-contained or clearly document dependencies.
* Include helpful error messages and handle edge cases gracefully.
* Provide parallel implementations for bash and PowerShell when targeting cross-platform use.

#### references/

Contains additional documentation that agents read when needed:

* *REFERENCE.md* for detailed technical reference material.
* Domain-specific files such as `finance.md` or `legal.md`.
* Keep individual reference files focused; agents load these on demand.

#### assets/

Contains static resources:

* Templates for documents or configuration files.
* Images such as diagrams or examples.
* Data files such as lookup tables or schemas.

#### Skill Content Structure

Skill files include these sections in order:

1. Title (H1): Clear heading matching skill purpose.
2. Overview: Brief explanation of what the skill does.
3. Prerequisites: Platform-specific installation requirements.
4. Quick Start: Basic usage with default settings.
5. Parameters Reference: Table documenting all options with defaults.
6. Script Reference: Usage examples for bash and PowerShell.
7. Troubleshooting: Common issues and solutions.
8. Attribution Footer: Standard footer with attribution.

### Progressive Disclosure

Structure skills for efficient context usage:

1. Metadata (~100 tokens): The `name` and `description` frontmatter fields load at startup for all skills.
2. Instructions (<5000 tokens recommended): The full *SKILL.md* body loads when the skill activates.
3. Resources (as needed): Files in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` load only when required.

Keep the main *SKILL.md* under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

### File References

When referencing other files in the skill, use relative paths from the skill root:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.

Run the extraction script:
scripts/extract.py
```

Keep file references one level deep from *SKILL.md*. Avoid deeply nested reference chains.

Validation guidelines:

* Include `name` frontmatter matching the skill directory name (required for skills and agents).
* Include `description` frontmatter (required).
* Provide parallel script implementations for bash and PowerShell when targeting cross-platform use.
* Document prerequisites for each supported platform.
* Keep *SKILL.md* under 500 lines; move detailed reference material to `references/`.
* Additional sections can be added between Parameters Reference and Troubleshooting as needed.

#### Attribution Footer

Skill files end with a standard attribution footer. Format the footer as a blockquote:

```markdown
> Brought to you by organization/repository-name
```

## Frontmatter Requirements

This section defines frontmatter field requirements for prompt engineering artifacts.

Maturity is tracked in `collections/*.collection.yml` item metadata, not in frontmatter. Do not include a `maturity` field in artifact frontmatter. Set maturity on the artifact's matching collection item entry; when omitted, maturity defaults to `stable`.

### Required Fields

All prompt engineering artifacts include this frontmatter field:

* `description:` - Brief description of the artifact's purpose. Required for all file types.

### Conditionally Required Fields

These fields are required depending on the file type:

* `name:` - Artifact identifier. Required for agent files and skill files. For agents, use lowercase kebab-case matching the filename without extension. For skills, match the skill directory name using lowercase kebab-case.
* `applyTo:` - Glob patterns defining which files trigger the instructions. Required for instructions files only.

### Optional Fields

Optional fields available by file type:

* `tools:` - Tool restrictions for agents and subagents. When omitted, all tools are accessible. When specified, list only tools available in the current VS Code context.
* `handoffs:` - Agent handoff declarations. Each entry includes `label` (display text, supports emoji), `agent` (target agent name), and optionally `prompt` (slash command to invoke) and `send` (boolean, auto-send the prompt when `true`).
* `agents:` - List of subagent dependencies for parent agents. Each entry is the subagent name without path or extension (for example, `codebase-researcher`). Required when the agent runs subagents.
* `user-invocable:` - Boolean. Set to `false` to hide the agent from the user and prevent direct invocation. Defaults to `true` when omitted. Use for subagents that should not appear in the agent picker.
* `disable-model-invocation:` - Boolean. Set to `true` to prevent Copilot from automatically invoking the agent. Use for agents that run subagents, agents that cause side effects (git operations, backlog management, deployments), or agents that should only run when explicitly requested. Defaults to `false` when omitted.
* `agent:` - Agent delegation for prompt files.
* `argument-hint:` - Hint text for prompt picker display.
* `model:` - Model specification. Accepts any valid model identifier string (for example, `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4`). When omitted, the default model is used.

### Frontmatter Examples

Agent with tools and subagents:

```yaml
---
name: prompt-builder
description: 'Orchestrates prompt engineering workflows'
disable-model-invocation: true
agents:
  - prompt-tester
  - prompt-evaluator
  - researcher-subagent
handoffs:
  - label: "💡 Update/Create"
    agent: prompt-builder
    prompt: "/prompt-build "
    send: false
---
```

Subagent with tool restrictions:

```yaml
---
name: prompt-tester
description: 'Tests prompt files in a sandbox environment'
user-invocable: false
tools:
  - read_file
  - create_file
  - run_in_terminal
---
```

Prompt file with agent delegation:

```yaml
---
description: 'Builds and validates prompt engineering artifacts'
agent: prompt-builder
argument-hint: "files=... [promptFiles=...] [requirements=...]"
---
```

Instructions file:

```yaml
---
description: "Required instructions for creating commit messages"
applyTo: '**'
---
```

### Tool Availability

When authoring prompts that reference specific tools:

* Verify tool availability in the current VS Code context before including in `tools:` frontmatter.
* When a user references tools not available in the active context, inform them which tools need to be enabled.
* Do not include tools that VS Code flags as unknown.

## Protocol Patterns

Protocol patterns apply to prompt and agent files. Skill files follow their own content structure defined in the Skill Content Structure section rather than step-based or phase-based protocols.

### Step-Based Protocols

Step-based protocols define groupings of sequential prompt instructions that execute in order. Add this structure when the workflow benefits from explicit ordering of distinct actions.

Structure guidelines:

* A `## Required Steps` section contains all steps and provides an overview of how the protocol flows.
* Protocol steps contain groupings of prompt instructions that execute as a whole group, in order.

Step conventions:

* Format steps as `### Step N: Short Summary` within the Required Steps section.
* Give each step an accurate short summary that indicates the grouping of prompt instructions.
* Include prompt instructions to follow while implementing the step.
* Steps can repeat or move to a previous step based on instructions.

Activation line: End the prompt file with a horizontal rule (`---`) followed by an instruction to begin. Activation lines apply only to prompt files; agent files and instructions files do not include them.

```markdown
## Required Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

* Read the target file and identify related files in the same directory.
* Document findings in a research log.

### Step 2: Apply Changes

* Update the target file based on research findings.
* Return to Step 1 if additional context is needed.

---

Proceed with the user's request following the Required Steps.
```

### Phase-Based Protocols

Phase-based protocols define groups of instructions for iterating on user requests through conversation. Add this structure when the workflow involves distinct stages that users move between interactively.

Structure guidelines:

* A `## Required Phases` section contains all phases and provides an overview of how the protocol flows.
* Protocol phases contain groupings of prompt instructions that execute as a whole group.
* Protocol steps (optional) can be added inside phases when a phase has a series of ordered actions.
* Conversation guidelines include instructions on interacting with the user through each of the phases.

Phase conventions:

* Format phases as `### Phase N: Short Summary` within the Required Phases section.
* Give each phase an accurate short summary that indicates the grouping of prompt instructions.
* Announce phase transitions and summarize outcomes when completing phases.
* Include instructions on when to complete the phase and move onto the next phase.
* Completing the phase can be signaled from the user or from some ending condition.

```markdown
## Required Phases

### Phase 1: Research

* Gather context from the user request and related files.
* Document findings and proceed to Phase 2 when research is complete.

### Phase 2: Build

* Apply changes based on research findings.
* Return to Phase 1 if gaps are identified during implementation.
* Proceed to Phase 3 when changes are complete.

### Phase 3: Validate

* Review changes against requirements.
* Return to Phase 2 if corrections are needed.
```

When a phase contains multiple ordered actions, nest steps inside the phase using a lower heading level:

```markdown
## Required Phases

### Phase 1: Execution and Evaluation

Orchestrates executing and evaluating prompt files iteratively.

#### Step 1: Execute Prompt Files

* Run the tester subagent with target prompt file paths.
* Collect execution findings from the sandbox.

#### Step 2: Evaluate Results

* Run the evaluator subagent with execution log paths.
* Review severity-graded findings.

#### Step 3: Interpret and Decide

1. Read the evaluation log to understand current state.
2. Move to Phase 2 if modifications are needed, or finalize if complete.
```

### Shared Protocol Placement

Protocols can be shared across multiple files by placing the protocol into a `{{name}}.instructions.md` file. Use `#file:` only when the full contents of the protocol file are needed; otherwise, refer to the file by path or to the relevant section.

### Required Protocol

A Required Protocol section defines meta-rules governing how steps or phases execute. This section is distinct from Required Steps (the actual work instructions) and Required Phases (the conversational stages).

Required Protocol typically specifies:

* Execution ordering and constraints (for example, all side effects stay within a sandbox folder).
* Repetition rules (for example, repeat Required Steps until the output is complete).
* Finalization actions (for example, clean up and interpret the output artifact).
* Side-effect boundaries (for example, read-only operations outside the sandbox).

Place the Required Protocol section after Required Steps or Required Phases:

```markdown
## Required Protocol

1. All execution and side effects stay within the sandbox folder.
2. Follow all Required Steps against the target files.
3. Repeat the Required Steps as needed to ensure completeness.
4. Finalize the output artifact and interpret it for the response.
```

### Intermediate Output Files

Subagents and autonomous agents often define a progressive output artifact that captures work in progress. Specify intermediate output files with three elements:

* Where the file lives: A path pattern using placeholders (for example, `.copilot-tracking/sandbox/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-{{topic}}-{{run}}/execution-log.md`).
* What gets documented: A bulleted list of content types the file captures (decisions, findings, evidence, questions).
* When it updates: State that the file is updated progressively as work proceeds, not written once at the end.

```markdown
## Execution Log

Create and update an *execution-log.md* file in the sandbox folder, progressively documenting:

* Each grouping of instructions followed and the reasoning behind actions taken.
* Decisions made when facing ambiguity and the rationale for each.
* Files created or modified within the sandbox and why.
* Observations about prompt clarity and completeness.
```

### Sandbox Environment

Agents that manage testing or validation use sandbox folders to isolate side effects:

* Sandbox root is `.copilot-tracking/sandbox/`.
* Naming convention follows `{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-{{topic}}-{{run-number}}` (for example, `2026-01-13-git-commit-001`).
* Test and execution agents create and edit files only within the assigned sandbox folder.
* Sandbox structure mirrors the target folder structure for realistic testing.
* Sandbox files persist for review and are cleaned up after validation completes.
* Cross-run continuity: Subagents can read and reference files from prior sandbox runs when iterating. Evaluation agents compare outputs across runs when validating incremental changes.

## Prompt Writing Style

Prompt instructions have the following characteristics:

* Guide the model on what to do, rather than command it.
* Written with proper grammar and formatting.

Additional characteristics:

* Use protocol-based structure with descriptive language when phases or ordered steps are needed.
* Use `*` bulleted lists for groupings and `1.` ordered lists for sequential instruction steps.
* Use **bold** only for human readability when drawing attention to a key concept.
* Use *italics* only for human readability when introducing new concepts, file names, or technical terms.
* Lines of prose content serve as prompt instructions. Blank lines, horizontal rules, code blocks, and section headers are structural elements rather than instructions.
* Follow standard markdown conventions and instructions for the codebase.
* Bulleted and ordered lists can appear without a title instruction when the section heading already provides context.

### Voice in Different Contexts

Prompt instructions and general guidance use a guidance style: describe what to do without commanding. Subagent action steps naturally use imperative voice ("Create the sandbox folder", "Read the target prompt", "Follow all Required Steps") because they define direct actions for autonomous execution. Both styles are appropriate in their respective contexts.

### User-Facing Responses

When instructions describe how to respond to users in conversation:

* Format file references as markdown links: `[filename](path/to/file)`.
* Format URLs as markdown links: `[display text](https://example.com)`.
* Use workspace-relative paths for file links.
* Do not wrap file paths or links in backticks. Backticks prevent the conversation viewer from rendering clickable links.
* Use placeholders like `{{YYYY-MM-DD}}` or `{{task}}` for dynamic path segments.

```markdown
<!-- Avoid backticks around file paths -->
2. Attach or open `.copilot-tracking/plans/2026-01-24-task-plan.instructions.md`.

<!-- Use markdown links for file references -->
2. Attach or open [2026-01-24-task-plan.instructions.md](.copilot-tracking/plans/2026-01-24-task-plan.instructions.md).

<!-- Use markdown links for URLs -->
See the [official documentation](https://docs.example.com/guide) for details.
```

Prefer guidance style over command style:

```markdown
<!-- Avoid command style -->
You must search the folder and you will collect all conventions.

<!-- Use guidance style -->
Search the folder and collect conventions into the research document.
```

### Patterns to Avoid

The following patterns provide limited value as prompt instructions:

* ALL CAPS directives and emphasis markers.
* Second-person commands with modal verbs (will, must, shall). For example, "You will" or "You must."
* Condition-heavy and overly branching instructions. Prefer providing a phase-based or step-based protocol framework.
* List items where each item has a bolded title line. For example, `* **Line item** - Avoid adding line items like this`.
* Forcing prompt instruction lists to have three or more items when fewer suffice.
* XML-style groupings of prompt instructions. Use markdown sections for grouping related prompt instructions instead.

## Prompt Key Criteria

Successful prompts demonstrate these qualities:

* Clarity: Each prompt instruction can be followed without guessing intent.
* Consistency: Prompt instructions produce similar results with similar inputs.
* Alignment: Prompt instructions match the conventions or standards provided by the user.
* Coherence: Prompt instructions avoid conflicting with other prompt instructions in the same or related prompt files.
* Calibration: Prompts provide just enough instruction to complete the user requests, avoiding overt specificity without being too vague.
* Correctness: Prompts provide instruction on asking the user whenever unclear about progression, avoiding guessing.

## Subagent Prompt Criteria

Prompt instructions for subagents keep the subagent focused on specific tasks.

Tool invocation:

* Run the named agent with `runSubagent` or `task` tools. If using the `runSubagent` tool then include instructions for the subagent to read and follow all instructions from the corresponding `.github/agents/` file.
* Reference subagent files using glob paths like `.github/agents/**/codebase-researcher.agent.md` so resolution works regardless of whether the subagent is at the root or in the `subagents/` folder.
* When neither `runSubagent` nor `task` tools are available, inform the user that one of these tools is required and should be enabled.
* Subagents cannot run their own subagents. Only the parent agent orchestrates all subagent calls.

Task specification:

* Specify which custom agents or instructions files to follow.
* Prompt instruction files can be selected dynamically when appropriate (for example, "Find related instructions files and have the subagent read and follow them").
* Indicate the types of tasks the subagent completes.
* Provide the subagent a step-based protocol when multiple steps are needed.
* State that the subagent does not have access to subagent tools and must proceed without them, completing work directly.

Response format:

* Provide a structured response format or criteria for what the subagent returns.
* When the subagent writes its response to files, specify which file to create or update.
* Allow the subagent to respond with clarifying questions to avoid guessing.

Execution patterns:

* Prompt instructions can loop and call the subagent multiple times until the task completes.
* Multiple subagents can run in parallel when work allows (for example, document researcher collects from documents while GitHub researcher collects from repositories).

Sandbox isolation:

* Direct test and execution subagents to create and modify files only within an assigned sandbox folder.
* Specify the sandbox root path and naming convention in the subagent invocation.
* State that side effects outside the sandbox are not permitted.

Intermediate file specification:

* Define the progressive output artifact the subagent creates (execution log, evaluation log, research document, tracking file).
* Specify the file path pattern and the content types documented.
* Instruct the subagent to update the artifact progressively rather than writing it once at the end.

Cross-run continuity:

* Provide prior sandbox run paths or prior output artifacts when iterating on a previous baseline.
* Instruct the subagent to compare outputs across runs when evaluating incremental changes.

Input specification:

* List all required inputs (target files, run number, sandbox path, purpose and requirements) and optional inputs (prior run paths, test scenarios) when invoking the subagent.
* Use consistent input naming across subagent invocations within the same parent agent.

Progressive feedback loops:

* Repeat subagent invocations with answers to clarifying questions until the task completes.
* Collect findings from completed subagent runs and feed them into subsequent invocations.
* Read subagent output artifacts progressively and integrate findings into parent-level documents.

## Prompt Quality Criteria

Every item applies to the entire file. Validation fails if any item is not satisfied. Mark items as N/A when the criteria do not apply to the artifact type (for example, subagent criteria do not apply to instructions files).

* [ ] File structure follows the File Types guidelines for the artifact type.
* [ ] Frontmatter includes required fields and follows Frontmatter Requirements.
* [ ] Protocols follow Protocol Patterns when step-based or phase-based structure is used.
* [ ] Instructions match the Prompt Writing Style.
* [ ] Instructions follow all Prompt Key Criteria.
* [ ] Subagent prompts follow Subagent Prompt Criteria when running subagents.
* [ ] External sources follow External Source Integration when referencing SDKs or APIs.
* [ ] Few-shot examples are in correctly fenced code blocks and match the instructions exactly.
* [ ] The user's request and requirements are implemented completely.

## External Source Integration

When referencing SDKs or APIs for prompt instructions:

* Prefer official repositories with recent activity.
* Extract only the smallest snippet demonstrating the pattern for few-shot examples.
* Get official documentation using tools and from the web for accurate prompt instructions and examples.
* Use MCP documentation tools (context7, microsoft-doc) when available to retrieve current API references.
* Use `fetch_webpage` and `github_repo` tools as research sources for external patterns and examples.
* Instruct researcher subagents to gather external documentation when the parent agent needs SDK or API context.
